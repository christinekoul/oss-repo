### 3: Why is it important to choose a license?

It is important to choose a license, so that others know how to use your software and it has legal protection. Without a license, companies or individual users might use your software in a way that you don't approve of.

### 4: Why is important that you shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have a license, because there are no guidelines to how you can use it. This can lead to many legal problems, such as someone stealing your source code with no credit.

### 5: Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?

In the "Failure to follow the open systems model" section of Why the Web beat Gopher, Richard Gabriel claims that "the right thing" design approach, tends to lose to "worse is better." This means that developers should release their softwar early in order to get a larger development community earlier on which will help improve the code. I agree with this claim, because a larger group of collaborators offer a more diverse set of opinions and suggestions. This will inevitably lead to better code with features and designs that satisfy a larger subset of people.

### 6: Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?

Under the GPL v2 license, Linux's source code may be used, modified, and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone. The GPL requires anyone who distributes code under its license to make the original source code available which aligns with Linux's open-source philosophy. The princicpal developer of Linux, Linus Torvalds, also stated "I felt that as long as people gave access to source back, I could always make it available on the internet for free, so the money angle really had been misplaced in the copyright. So in the meantime people have pointed me to the GPLv2, and I decided that rather than just change my license by editing it again, I should just use an existing one.", while talking about his choice to use the GPL license.
